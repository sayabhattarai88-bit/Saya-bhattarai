        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
           My name is Rina Bhattarai. I m from Chitwan. I was born in 2061-07-015 . Recently I have completed my
       SLC Examination from Ankurum Academy as a science student.  Now I am pursuing my bachelors in Birendra Multiple Campus as a BICTE Student.
       As a BICTE student, I was assigned a task of creating portfolio. I have compiled a portfolio that includes my project. This portfolio reflects my abilities in coding and overall web development
        practice. It serves as a comprehensive representation of my progress. </p>

            <h3>Computer</h3>
            <p>Computer is an electronic machine that takes input, processes it , store it and give a meaningful output.
        Computer run on software, which includes system software like operating system and application software such as browsers, games, and office tools. </p>

            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system—those parts that you can actually touch. It includes essential elements like the CPU, which processes information, and the RAM, which stores data temporarily while the computer is running. Storage devices such as hard drives and solid-state drives keep data permanently, while the motherboard connects all components so they can communicate. Other important hardware parts include the power supply, which provides electricity, and peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, monitor, and printer. Together, these hardware components allow a computer to operate and perform various tasks.

            <h3>software</h3>
            <p>Software is a comprehensive set of instructions, programs, and data that enable a computer or digital device to perform specific tasks, solve problems, or manage hardware resources. Unlike hardware, which consists of the physical components of a computer, software is intangible—it exists as code written in programming languages and executed by the machine. Software acts as the intermediary layer between users and hardware, translating human intentions into machine-level operations..</p>
